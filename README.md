# React/Redux/Webpack/JSON server boilerplate

Made to start up a development environment that already has some powerful react-redux featrures, alongside a dev-env json server for mocking the backend.

Done with love following this lovely individual's tutorial: https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/

Simply fork, ```npm install```, run with ```npm start```, and bob's your uncle.
